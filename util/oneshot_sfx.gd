class_name SFX
extends Resource
## Utility class for creating and destroying a singular sound effect
## using a temporary [AudioStreamPlayer]. [br]
##
## A sound effect gets assigned to 2 groups, one representing all SFX played by
## the same audio bus, and one for all SFX played by the caller node.
## The names of these groups are [code]<bus name>[/code] and
## [code]<node name>/sfx[/code] respectively.


## Creates an [AudioStreamPlayer], assigns the corresponding data,
## adds it to node, then destroys it when finished.
